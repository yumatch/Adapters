## Current Proposals

THe current proposals for Data types can be found in this Google Doc ([view access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TIiIm0aYILd02tfLM57IaLEOs94f1OYa12d5hIw7B_4/edit?usp=sharing)). This unified schema proposal would allow users to declare that they're loading in data with a consistent schema as some other dataset that's also on [Grid]().

(Additional ideas for Data Sources and Adapters can be found in the [ideas](https://github.com/OpenMined/Adapters/blob/master/ideas.md) document).
